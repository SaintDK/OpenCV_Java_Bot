The bot is built with OpenCV, created for training

Adapted and calibrated for ore mining in "EVE online"

1. to start you need to change all "enter window name" to the name of your window
2. take control of a ship called Ventura
3. reduce the window to the smallest possible
4. place mining guns on F1 and F2
5. open Mining hold
6. while in the dock, run MinerTest2.java

6. click to star on https://github.com/SaintDK/OpenCV_Java_Bot

I recommend making changes only in the existing cycle
