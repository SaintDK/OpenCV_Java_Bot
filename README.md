The bot is built with OpenCV, created for training

Adapted and calibrated for ore mining in "EVE online"

1. to start you need to change all "enter window name" to the name of your window
2. open inventory
3. open Mining hold
4. take control of a ship called Ventura
5. reduce the window to the smallest possible
6. place mining guns on F1 and F2
7. while in the dock, run MinerTest2.java

I recommend making changes only in the existing cycle
