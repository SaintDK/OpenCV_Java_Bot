The bot is built with OpenCV, built to improve my (at the time of writing) weak programming skills.

How to start?


1. to start you need to change all "enter window name" to the name of your window
2. take control of a ship called Ventura
3. reduce the window to the smallest possible
4. place mining guns on F1 and F2
5. while in the dock, run MinerTest2.java

I recommend making changes only in the existing cycle
